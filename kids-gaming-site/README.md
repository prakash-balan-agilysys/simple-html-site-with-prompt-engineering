# Kids Gaming Site

This project is a functional, visually appealing, and interactive website for kids, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

## How it Works

The site's branding and content are dynamically loaded from JSON files:

- `data/branding.json`: This file drives the site's branding. It contains the organization's name, logo, favicon, slogan, contact information (email, mobile), and social media links. By modifying this file, you can instantly update the site's look and feel to match your brand.
- `data/games.json`: Provides the list of games.

This separation of data from presentation makes the site easy to customize and maintain.

## Learning Checkpoints

- **TODO:** Customize the branding in `data/branding.json` to make the site your own.
- **TODO:** Add more games to `data/games.json`.
- **TODO:** Implement a search/filter feature for the games in `scripts.js`.
- **TODO:** Add navigation links to the header in `index.html`.
